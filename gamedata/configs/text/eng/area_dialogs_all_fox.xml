		<text>Not your business.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="change_faction_to_killer_4">
		<text>Shut up, you head of the gramophone. I don't think you're right for us. Because the key to our job is secrecy. You got a big mouth on you, bite it. Being a mercenary is about keeping secrets which only you and the customer will know. However, for a price, I'll overlook it, because I assume you've learned your lesson? 10,000, that's payment for your tongue. Pay it, and you'll be one of us. You got it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="change_faction_to_killer_5">
		<text>That's right. Hehehe, I think you're right for us. Secrecy is just as important in our business as the accuracy of the order. It doesn't matter who is in front of you. The motive should only be with you and the customer. And every agent is impersonal. However, I can't accept you without an investment. 10 thousand is enough. Consider it an investment. You will earn much more with us.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="change_faction_to_killer_6">
		<text>Yeah, I get it. Here you go.</text>

	<string id="Klin_Guide_3">
		<text>The gun barrel is a delicate thing. To replace it you need to have two things: the barrel itself and a set for its replacement. As a rule, the barrel is either bought or extracted from the weapon by a special set of tools corresponding to its application. There are three types. As well as in the case of disassembly of clothes on the receipt of component parts affects the subject, its condition and your skills. I also want to add that when disassembling rusty, obsolete and new weapons, the final parts will correspond to the quality of it... Rusty or dirty barrels will not work, so they will need to be cleaned and cleaned. They clean the barrels with different means: gasoline, kerosene, vodka, water, solvents, cleaning kits and many others. Replacement kits are different, that is, for each caliber has its own set. Basically, these field kits can be found with traders. By the way, not every weapon and caliber can be replaced by a barrel, this also take into account.</text>

	<string id="Klin_Guide_4">
		<text>Tell me about the suit disassembly.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="Klin_Guide_5">
		<text>Well, the suits are not difficult to disassemble, the main thing here is precision. They are mainly disassembled in sets, they are sold by traders. More advanced equipment is disassembled only with the help of appropriate tools available. There are three types of tools for such work. The number of received components also depends on personal skills and the state of the object to be disassembled... All the important details are cut out of the costumes, the rest is thrown away, because here, in the Zone, there is no use from such trifles. Then they repair their equipment or sell the obtained parts. Certain things made of fabric such as Balaklavas or simple clothes like jackets, as well as some of their components can be disassembled with a knife. The number of components that can be produced depends on the strength of the object to be disassembled and personal skills. Also, as a rule, disassemble only those suits from which there is something to get. For example, on jackets or raincoats makes no sense even to spend their time and money, and on the disassembly of exoskeletons, well... that's the source of income.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="Klin_Guide_6">
		<text>Tell me about the suit repair.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="Klin_Guide_7">
		<text>In the field, suits can also be repaired in a homemade way, of course, but it is possible. Almost everything from rags to heavy armour plates is used in reparation. The consumables themselves will not be glued to the costume, so you still need something that can be organized to sew the whole thing. There are sets for sewing and reparations, there can be something else. And the consumables are also important. It is better to use high-quality materials, than garbage, because it can all cost more than the equipment. Glue, sewing and repair kits can be bought from traders. Consumables can be obtained by yourself, for example, from disassembly of suits, or also bought from traders. It is worth noting that each outfit has its own repair kits with appropriate restrictions. If the condition of the equipment is below the capabilities of the kit, repair is not possible. Also, each repair kit improves the condition of the object, but using additional components specified in the kit, it is possible to achieve a better repair.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="Klin_Guide_8">
		<text>Tell me about the weapons reparation.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="Klin_Guide_9">
		<text>Weapons in the zone are difficult and expensive to keep in good condition. Repair by a professional is expensive, so you have to use improvised means to take care of your weapon on a regular basis. To repair guns, just like to repair suits, you need consumables and repair kits. All the parts can be bought from traders or get them yourself, for example, many stalkers disassemble the barrels with hand and repair them themselves.</text>
