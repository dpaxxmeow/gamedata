				\n Iron Forest - Archianomaly, is a large accumulation of anomalies "electra". In the south-west of Zaton there is an old electrical substation. In this place, electricity "came out" of wires and transformers, forming a large field of anomalies "electra". The name of the dangerous substation was apparently due to the numerous metal supports of the power transmission lines in the territory. In some places of this archeanomaly there is an increased radiation background. \n

				\n Pineoak - an unusual archeanomalya, a cluster of sodas under a tree "dome". A fairly new type of symbiotic anomaly, formed as a result of the "fusing" of some species of trees, usually oak and pine. It is well distinguished from afar by the unusual shape of the "dome" from tree trunks, which in themselves are harmless, in contrast to the accumulating hazardous chemicals under it, often concentrating in the anomaly "Soda". Getting under a dome of anomaly, any organic "burns out", as if covered with organic acid. There is a version that an anomaly, like a predator, dissolving organic matter, feeds itself. \n

Similar "brain" lawns and glades are often formed near the towers of power transmission lines and other metal structures that play the role of antennas in the transmission of psi waves by Caymanov installations. In such places, hallucinations, loss of movement coordination, severe headaches and various mental disorders are not uncommon. With prolonged exposure to Psi-radiation, the human brain either disintegrates completely, or undergoes irreversible changes, transforming its carrier into a zombified one. One of the biggest zones of psi-radiation is the "Burnout of the Brains". When hit by Psi-radiation, voices and whispers are heard, it is difficult to concentrate on shooting. \n
				\n In the Zone, there is a specific effect on the human psyche and the brain as a whole, called psi-radiation. This Impact is extremely negative. Being under intense psi-radiation, a person can get serious brain damage, which leads to insanity at best or to destruction of the person and zombie at worst. A zombie is a human shell that preserves only some of the simplest reflexes, but completely lost memory (except for separate fragments), the ability to think and does not have a sense of self-awareness. \n
				%c[0,255, 218, 185]Psi-radiation%c[default] can be divided into two types according to the appearance pattern. The first is the man-made psi-fields with the help of special installations. It was this psi-field that was generated by radiators on Radar and at the Yantar plant, which prevented the penetration of stalkers to the center of the Zone. It is worth noting that the Psi-radiation on the Radar forced the stalkers to see hallucinations in the form of Phantoms - translucent mutants. The second type is created by the Zone. Small psi-foci are often found near power poles, as well as in archeanomalies (for example, "Scar"). \n
				In addition, the Controllers are able to generate directed Psi-radiation and create dangerous psy-fields around themselves. \n
				Scientists at Yantar has developed a special device that reduces the Impact of psi-radiation.\n

				\n The Springboard anomaly is very common and can be found almost anywhere in the Zone, both outside and in buildings. To the naked eye, the anomaly appears as a rippling heat haze or air fluctuation accompanied by dancing leaves and sometimes crimson-colored stains on the ground. Throwing a bolt into a Springboard causes it to send out its distinctive shockwave, making it easily identifiable. It is also one of the anomalies that are harmless to pass through for a split moment after having been triggered, making bolts very useful tools for navigating a Springboard field. As players approach a Springboard their vision becomes gradually but markedly brighter as they get closer to the anomaly itself.
				\nSpringboards are easily identifiable, and easily avoidable but varying locations and odd spawn points in the games can make them a nuisance in a firefight. Players have often died in the middle of a fight, forgetting or not noticing the anomaly's presence with all the distractions, then walking straight into it. Just like all anomalies, its best to scout the location and find a way around it. \n	
				\n\n
				\n%c[0,173, 216, 230]"It was one of the first types of anomalies ever recorded. A Springboard is an unstable gravitational field limited to a pocket on ground level, about 1-2 meters wide. Reacts to the presence of creatures or objects by sending out a powerful shockwave that damages anything within radius. The damage caused by this changes throughout the anomaly's lifetime, ranging from minor bruises through serious wounds to instant death."%c[0,215,215,215] Encyclopedia.%c[default] \n

				\One of the first recorded anomalies. Causes impact damage by a variable gravitational field. Stays in one place for an average of a week, varying its impact strength during its "life". The result of an encounter with %c[0,160,82,45]Trumpin%c[default] can vary from minor bruises and contusions to instant death. During daylight hours, it is fairly easy to spot by distortions in the air above it, swirling foliage, and distinctive red-brown spots on the ground. Detected by any kind of detector, as well as by objects planted in it (bolts). \n
				\n Lift%c[default] is a gravitational anomaly, within which the Earth's gravity weakens. Gradually drifting in it for a few seconds, you can get out of it. Completely invisible. Also draws in corpses. Invisible to the human eye. Often you can only get into the anomaly from the acceleration, otherwise it will be "pushed" back out of the anomaly. At low acceleration on the way out of the anomaly it can "pull" back in. \n
				\n\n
				\n%c[0,173, 216, 230]"This anomaly was one of the first to be discovered back in 2008 on the field of the stadium in Pripyat. Since then, it has become increasingly common in various places in the Zone. An experienced eye can easily detect the anomaly by the fluctuations in the air, distorting objects, leaves swirling around, and traces of unfortunates caught in the epicenter.

				\n This anomaly is usually found outdoors. It resembles moss or vines, hanging down like curtains from its growing spot. Reacts to rapidly approaching living beings by discharging a cloud of projectiles severely injuring uncovered or lightly protected skin upon contact. Does not react to slowly moving targets. Burnt Fuzz is generally considered the least dangerous anomaly in the Zone since it can be easily spotted and avoided. Even so, players rarely seem to take damage when coming into contact with the anomaly. Touching a Burnt Fuzz curtain seems to elicit a reaction from the anomaly, but only players with little or no armor have reported being hurt by it.

				\n An anomaly of presumably gravitational nature. When triggered, the tremendous power of the Vortex drags everything within the radius 10-15 meters towards the center. Victims drawn into the core have little to no chance of survival: their bodies are quickly constricted into a tight lump, only to be blown up in a powerful discharge of energy a moment later.  In some cases, they may levitate in air with agony, and soon their entire systems are shredded into mere skeletal and flesh parts.
				\n The anomaly remains stationary throughout its lifetime (a week on average). Easily recognizable in daylight by the air fluctuation above, dancing leaves, fragments of dismembered corpses lying around and a distinctive dark stain in the center. Highly dangerous at night since it can be revealed only by means of a detector or by throwing metal objects into it.
				\n The difference between a Whirligig and a Vortex is pretty simple: size and strength. The Vortex has a much larger range, much harder to escape from than a Whirligig, and it deals a lot more damage. Escaping the Vortex anomaly, once dragged in, can range in difficulty from easy to downright impossible, depending on the strength of the anomaly and the difficulty level. The type of armor worn is also very important, as the odds are that you will take at least one hit. One possible method of escaping, once drawn in, is to wait until the anomaly discharges, taking the hit. After discharging, the anomaly has no pulling power for approximately one second, allowing you to sprint out and escape it. This method will only be possible with armor with high anomaly protection. Wearing an exoskeleton and getting caught in a Vortex almost always ends in the player's death, since it prevents sprinting; meaning that the player cannot escape the anomaly once drawn in. \n

				\n The Burner can be a bit difficult to see, even in daylight, as it's only revealed by a faint heat haze. If the anomaly is triggered by either a living being or an object such as a metal bolt, it shoots out a tall pillar of flame in the air, burning everything in its vicinity. Though somewhat rare, the Burner anomaly is often found in clusters. Some clusters also emit extreme high ambient temperature, which hurts anything in their vicinity. Burners can emit temperatures as low as 100 degrees Celsius, up to several thousand, hot enough to crack concrete and melt metal, which explains why some Burners appear in areas that have massive cracks and severe damaged soil, while other sites are untouched.
				\n Burners are very dangerous at high difficulties, and can be extremely dangerous even with top-tier armor. The Burners don't have a set spawn point like other anomalies do, or even a set trigger point. Simply being in the same vicinity can trigger a conflagration. A tactic for avoiding damage is to first throw a bolt into the anomaly, triggering it, then quickly running through the jet of flame. This tactic, if used repeatedly and without delay, can mean the difference between traversing a cluster unharmed and getting scorched at least once. \n

				\n %c[0,47, 79, 79]Radiation%c[default] - radioactive spots left over from the 1986 catastrophe.\n
				\n Radiation contaminated sites can also be called an anomaly. Only on the cod of the Geiger counter can we roughly determine the boundaries of a dangerous place. Typically, the phonet is an abandoned technique. X-ray can be picked up on the edges of the game areas. The further the player moves north, the more often he will see the infected spots. At the Chernobyl nuclear power station it is not even worthwhile to put on without a suit with good radiation protection. \n

				\n The Fruit Punch is a puddle of lambent green liquid that is easily visible in almost any environment due to its bright glow and distinctive hissing and bubbling noises. On contact with creatures or objects such as bolts, a Fruit Punch lights up brightly and emits a sharp hissing sound. It is extremely corrosive, damaging creatures and objects on contact. Any matter left in a Fruit Punch will eventually dissolve, hinting at the anomaly's corrosive nature and spelling doom for any protective suit. For players, contact with a Fruit Punch will cause damage with each 'flash'. This anomaly is commonly found underground.
				\n Concerning its characteristics, it is generally accepted that it derives from the remnants of a highly radioactive spill of some reactive substance that gained its anomalous abilities from the Zone. Its corrosive properties are exhibited by its intense and rapid damage to all living tissue and inorganic matter, metal and plastic alike. \n

				\n Liquid education is not clear until the end of nature. It looks like a glowing bright green slime, well visible in the dark. When in contact with the body, it causes injuries similar to those of strong acids. In a suit with a closed cycle of breathing, the damage will be minimal. In this anomaly non-stop strange chemical processes occur. Their result is acid, corrosive to the skin, and poisonous gases that equally corrode the lungs. Fortunately,% c [0,107, 142, 35] Kissel% c [default] is easy to see in the open area. Worse, when you suddenly find it in a dark tunnel. \n

			%c[guide_blue]Blowouts%c[default], also known as %c[guide_blue]Emissions%c[default], are sudden emissions of a huge amount of radiation.\n
			\n%c[guide_green]Information:%c[default]
			\nStrong winds, thunderclouds and scarlet red sky appear with the onset of the ejection, accompanied by numerous eruptions of thunder and a deep roar underfoot.\n
			\nThese events begin with a sharp surge of radioactive, abnormal and psionic activity - and end up destroying most of life when radiation waves cover the Zone.\n
			\nDespite the fact that it is extremely lethal, it is still quite easy to survive as a result of the release, hiding in buildings or underground tunnels, until it ends.\n
			\nIn much the same way as a psi-storm, the huge amount of energy released by the outburst seems to "recharge" many anomalies, allowing stalkers to find new artifacts in them.

			%c[guide_blue]Phantoms%c[default] are illusory beings that exist in the mind, and not physically.\n
			\n%c[guide_green]Information:%c[default]
			\nWhile it is difficult to classify it as an anomaly or a mutant, the phantom is an involuntary mental projection of the mutant that is currently in the Zone. \n
			\nThese projections are always accompanied by audible "howling" noise and appear luminous and transparent, gradually floating towards the victim through the walls and through the air. \n
			\nIt is not known why they only take the form of mutants, including those that the stalker has never encountered, and why they never see those that are now extinct, such as Tark. \n
			\nThe leading theory of this phenomenon suggests that the living mutants of the Zone are to some extent strongly connected with the noosphere, and that due to this, psi fields inadvertently imprint their appearance and hostile nature in the minds of its victims. \n
			\nSome stalkers equip their helmets with a fine mesh of copper wire and also their lodging for the night and even tents in order to protect themselves from the harmful effects of the ejection. Some stalkers constantly carry small sapper shovels with them, and if they feel that an ejection is coming soon and there is not a single shelter around, they immediately begin to dig a hole and dig in it. In 50% of cases, this method of shelter from ejection can save lives in the zone. \n
			\nIt is rumored that an experimental drug was delivered to the Zone that allows the body to go into suspended animation for a short time and then wake up, but this drug did not pass proper testing.

			%c[guide_blue]Psi-storms%c[default] consist of several psi-vortices that release a deadly amount of psionic energy.\n
			\n%c[guide_green]Information:%c[default]
			\nThese unusual weather anomalies are a very recent phenomenon in the Zone, and there are many assumptions about what causes them to appear.\n
			\nStarting with a purple-pink haze and large formations of thunderclouds, very little time is required to create a psi storm and begin the destruction of the Zone.\n
			\nIf the stalker's equipment gives the owner greater protection from psionic damage or uses drugs to provide a similar effect, one can survive the loss of individual psi-vortices during a storm without shelter.\n
			\nThis is ensured by the fact that they immediately begin to meditate after that, since even the most trained stalkers will still find themselves in a very delicate situation after such an impact.\n
			\nLike emissions, a huge amount of energy dissipated by a psi storm, it seems, "recharges" many anomalies, allowing stalkers to find in them new artifacts.\n
			\nSome stalkers equip their helmets with a fine wire mesh net and also their lodging to protect themselves from the harmful effects of the release.
