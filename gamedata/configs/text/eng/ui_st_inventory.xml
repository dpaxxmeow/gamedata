		<text>Wound protection\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]The level of protection of the body from mechanical influences remains an extremely important factor when working in the Chernobyl exclusion zone, and it should not be underestimated. More often, this is due to the aggressive fauna of local territories, the inhabitants of which were overly mutated due to the special effects of the exclusion zone.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Collective term %c[0,210,210,210]'Mutants'%c[0,170,170,170] refers to the creatures of the animal and, probably, of human origin, which are the result of such a non-standard evolution. They can take different volumes and shapes depending on their predecessors and the degree of mutation - and also have at their disposal several ways of causing damage and killing their victims. The main types of attacks include bites, cuts of the skin and clothing with sharp claws, stabbing the victim with sticking fangs, jumping on the prey, and kicking and kicking if they are human beings.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]The most popular means of protection against this threat is the use of clothing made in such a way as to make it practically impenetrable for animal attacks. Although, usually even a thin layer of protective material can protect you from danger, in the exclusion zone, however it is recommended to use only specially designed anti-rupture fibers in the Research Institute for safe location next to predators. For convenience, such fibers are integrated almost into all modern types of bullet-proof armor.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]. This also applies to any protection %c[0,210,210,210]CLASS AIII%c[0,170,170,170] and higher, which have a greater number of complex %c[0,210,210,210]metal plates%c[0,170,170,170]. The use of metal plates to date is the most effective method of protecting the fighter from breaking factors.\n \n%c[ui_green]IMPORTANT:\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Even considering that clothing of high strength and thickness can significantly reduce the damage from firearms and shells, as well as attacks of animals of all kinds, the materials from which clothing is sewn will deteriorate over time, gradually reducing its anti-anomalous and physical protection. Armor damaging speed %c[0,210,210,210]is not a constant%c[0,170,170,170] and depends on the state of the internal parts, which means that %c[0,210,210,210]the condition of the outfit will worsen as quickly as the damage it gets.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]For this reason %c[0,210,210,210]strongly recommended%c[0,170,170,170] carry out maintenance of suits and helmets as often as possible and avoid heavy, structural damage from the outside.\n \n \n</text>
