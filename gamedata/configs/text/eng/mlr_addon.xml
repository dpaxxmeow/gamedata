	<string id="talk_to_maps_3">
		<text>...hm. \nLook, this is Bar. It is completely safe for "Duty Friends" and neutrals. \nOn the west is Wild Territory, this is the former western part of the plant "Rostock" factory. According to rumors, it is better not to go there at night. The most advantageous points for shooting are held by Mercs, you will get in the middle of two dangers. Below the mutants, from which it is most profitable to climb the hills in the form of former warehouses, the hills themselves are controlled by snipers and shooters of mercenaries. All about the wilderness.\n North - Army Warehouses. Duty's "best" friends, Freedom keep it. There is nothing special there, except that this is the last "Bastion" of normal thinking people. \On the east - Truck Cemetery, buy some antirads and buckshot if you go there. There are a lot of mutants there and sometimes the radiation level is not friendly. \nSouth - Garbage, full of anarchy there, mutants, bandits, but there is also a "flea market", which can be a good bargain plus, in the hangar there is a hunter, who can find a job and naturally reward. \nThis is all in the neighboring territories. What else can I tell you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_maps_4">
		<text>It's all clear, but you were talking about "normal thinking" and "Bastion".</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_maps_5">
		<text>North of the Army Warehouses is Monolith territory - "Radar", a terrible place, stay away from it. If you're going there, you'll have to stock up on bullets and first-aid kits.</text>

	<string id="story_dolg_1">
		<text>Okay, with the Freemen so far silence, digging up, and we and they, I think there will be no special cases soon. Of course, we won't leave them alone, let them not relax. \nThe rest: Bandits aren't dangerous. "The Blue" ones aren't as interested in us as we are in them, but you have to keep your ears sharp with the mercenaries, especially during various searches. The rest of the groups and clans are not dangerous or hostile, except for Monolith. I think there's something bad going on. We don't border on them for good.</text>

		<text>How's it going with Duty?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="story_dolg_3">
		<text>Average, three out of five. Shaky stability in terms of fighters and their influx, but as long as new ones come, not all is lost. Things are worse with the control of territories, on the southern approaches to the eastern part of Pripyat, we could not hold on to the Yanov station. The southern ways to Bar are constantly attacked by bandits and mutants, from the east sometimes pressed by mercs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_4">
		<text>How did you lose your place on Yanov?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_5">
		<text>The black lane went off, first our supply guy was exposed in those parts. The bastard was shoving weapons at all who were not lazy, bandits and mercenaries in general, then he was caught by local Stalkers and was killed in a deal with some types of people, I was charged as a leader. Then an unidentified stalker came out of his skin to get us out of here. This is the result.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_m_1">
		<text>I migrated from Agroproma, promoted me. Before I got into the Zone, I was a locksmith. They appreciate my hands in the group, so they decided to transfer me here. I prefer heavy and assault weapons, I hate snipers in terms of upgrades.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_m_2">
		<text>And why are there so many bottles around, Duty for a healthy life?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="story_dolg_m_3">
		<text>I can, the work is tedious, and boring here - but you will not go back, there is no base on the Agroindustry. Although I don't know, I would have been alive then, they say the base was killed during the ejection in 2011. Something we have moved away from a theme, do not be shy, give here the toys.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_m_4">
		<text>I'm gonna decide what and how to do it now.</text>
	</string>	

	<string id="story_b_cs_0">
		<text>What can you say about the Cold?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_1">
		<text>And what do you say, the guys think his views on the grouping are correct.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_2">
		<text>And how did he win such "love"?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_3">
		<text>You know, Lebedev, even though I didn't catch him, but people began to dislike him. He didn't ask for the opinion of the members of the group when he moved them on that very last campaign. That mercenary certainly helped us, but it wasn't worth the "sheepskin dressing up. Those who stayed at the base couldn't do anything about it with the reinforcements of that rabble who had returned after the defeat of the "Renegades". The meaning of the capture of the Swamp came to naught, and the victims were also in vain on their way to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_4">
		<text>I think I'm starting to get the guys' outrage about the former leader.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_5">
		<text>Listen next... When the rest of the squad returned, we had to fight for a long time and return everything back. We wouldn't have managed in life, the cold through the familiar "free" stalkers came to the guys from the landfill and Cordon, helped the loners and charisma of the new leader. Besides, he gave his word in front of all the fighters without exception not to leave here. Any help, but not the life of our guys.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_6">
		<text>What's the purpose of your grouping now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_7">
		<text>The zone increases every day and we do our best to stop this process. Some are fighting to keep this phenomenon alive, some are fighting to destroy it, but we have our own goals here, and we're not leaving here until we finish them. Okay, it's time to quit fables and probably buy something.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_8">
		<text>Okay.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="story_dog_0">

		<text>Wow, you can't tell by looking at him that he needs it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_3">
		<text>Appearances can be misleading. A beast of the soul, may I now explain to you about these "dogs" and ask you for something?</text>

	<string id="story_dog_4">
		<text>Go ahead.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_5">
		<text>"Pseudo-dogs", "Psi-dogs" and "Chernobyls" aren't dogs at all, they seem to be descended from wolves. That's what they taught me in the Duty.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_6">
		<text>Really, I should write it down, what's the request?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_7">
		<text>I gather all sorts of stories by virtue of my profession, since we're talking about pseudo-dogs. At the very outskirts of the Plant there is a place similar to our Swamps, it's called Zaton. I heard there's a weirdo on the Old Barge, and he's got a pseudo-dog, too, whether it's fiction or not - you can find out.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_8">
		<text>Okay, I'll check if I can.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="owl_story_0">
		<text>Tell me about this "Quiet Harbor".</text>
	</string>
	<string id="owl_story_1">
		<text>There was a strange stalker who turned out to be an USS major. He helped clean up the neighborhood quite well. But otherwise, some kind of asshole has started recently. Psi-set and "Burner" are working again. There's movement at Chernobyl, and it's not far from here. First, a detachment of experienced stalkers disappeared, then as I heard another squad ran into the "monoliths" in the Sawmill area. After the mess with the soldiers people scattered, which took advantage of the mutants: now close to our "bark". In general, the whole northern part of the Zaton became dangerous, take it into account.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="owl_story_2">
		<text>Is there anything important in mind?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="owl_story_3">
		<text>There's always something, these cases made my situation a little better. People from the Big Earth are losing their children, husbands and brothers, and of course they care about them. A lot of suckers showed up after hearing about the big score and hiding from all sorts of problems. I want their PDAs. Anything you find, you bring it here. I'll make it worth your while, you hear me?</text>

	<string id="boroda_story_2">
		<text>Yes - decided to look at the famous "Skadovsk" personally, what can you do here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="boroda_story_3">
		<text>Yes, anything, after the departure of the Sultan was not so intense in the vicinity to search for artifacts. If you go to the South, towards the Shops of Substations or Waste Recycling Station, be careful. The syndicate there keeps the territory, though adequate, but dangerous. If you find any artifacts, bring them here - you will stay in a good mood and in good time. Good luck.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="boroda_story_4">
		<text>And you don't get sick.</text>
	</string>
	
  <string id="aslan_st_0">
		<text>How and how best to get to work.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_1">
		<text>Look here: "The syndicate in the Zone has only one central base - ours. The trail to the South is cut off, the psi installation on the Amber works again, and the crowds of zombars sometimes hug the mutants from there. Limansk in the North is occupied by us, but further away the places are ruined - a continuous labyrinth and fanatics. There are Army Warehouses in the East, the territory of Freedom.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_2">
		<text>[further...]</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_3">
		<text>Think about the dangers - you'll estimate it yourself, but keep in mind that when you're fulfilling orders - you're at work and you're in the middle of a job and you're in the middle of a sniffle, throw it away or put it on the shelf, no morale - just a calculation. About the trails through Limansk, it is the safest in terms of movement. The space there is closed, the snipers can't lead you, there are plenty of shelters to cover you from being thrown out and in case of a long firefight. There are also minuses - it is unpredictability of terrain, you do not know what waits around the corner.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_4">
		<text>You're saying the base is central, so there are more outposts?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_5">
		<text>Of all the people I know, there are three small dots. The first one is on the Zaton, at the edge of the endless fucking "northern" bogs. The second one is at the devil's side, on the outskirts of the Pripyat. We also have a group settled down, among which a provider is behind the bridge in Limansk, on the outskirts of the "Red Forest". You can also meet our groups all over the Zone during the execution of various contracts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_6">
		<text>After Limansk is the Monolith territory, I understand.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_7">
		<text>The hospital there is old, but there is no sense to climb there - the path to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, as well as to the plant Amber cut off by psi-radiation. How will you find yourself in Limansk, stick to the road to the South, but hide your bullets and first-aid kits.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_8">
		<text>Acccepted, huge "thank you".</text>
	</string>

	<string id="sultan_st_0">
		<text>Say something about yourself.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_1">
		<text>Listen carefully. I am a local godfather, you already know my name. Not so long ago I stumbled here from Zaton and pulled the guys with me. We squeezed out the mutants from here and revived the base. On Zaton I was thrown off by one hell of a man. I pretended to be my own and set me up. I had to depart from there.</text>

	<string id="sultan_st_7">
		<text>Listen carefully, kid. From the North from us the Cemetery of technics, our boys there at the old checkpoint near the road and exits from the Army Warehouses keep the stamp, at the Cemetery of that try not to shake at night and in general bypass the old iron. The background sometimes cracked so that the ringing of eggs in the pants can be heard, plus anomalies around and "zerushki" local do not sleep. From the west, the dump is full of anarchy and I won't be able to tell you anything specific about it, I know exactly about the debtors' checkpoint in the north. There is a huge grove in the south, the Dark Hollow is called a wilderness - soldiers there periodically patrol and hang out there. I forgot to say about the Hollow, on the way to it, but we already have an old stalkers' eyes on the Farm blistering, neater. The Grove of that has a huge plus, the road and exit from it lead to Cordon, our find no problem. On Cordon ATP old try to hold on.</text>

Money was paid with "gulkin horseradish", there was enough money for drinking. Once we went out with the kent, I couldn't even remember a fight over what. Anyway, I stabbed him with a screwdriver, and it was a good thing he didn't fall down. They gave me a few years of planing. The bitch's wife while I was sitting there sold out and got away. He leaned back when he drove the house and all that was left in it. He drank the money and was bummed out for a long time after that. As the Zone was formed, I decided to pull here, all the whips are the same. I went to the Blatnye dump, assessing me as a mechanic, the locals allowed me to stay.

		<text>Yes, Spleen's the name.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_tech_mlr_st_2">
		<text>Interesting name, why is it called so?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_tech_mlr_st_3">
		<text>Spleen - "despondency", "moping". At the very beginning of my life in the Zone, I lost a friend and was worried about it for a long time, had little communication at the time and was very boring. That's where I got attached.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_tech_mlr_st_4">
		<text>Sick, where did you come from?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_tech_mlr_st_5">
		<text>When the rumors about the soldiers in Pripyat and their departure passed, plus the defeated "Monolith" on the outskirts of the Pripyat, a lot of people moved or intended to move to places that are closer to the Center of the Zone. I just didn't like them very much, the noise was bigger. I "went" to Pripyat, almost took a bullet from a monolithic man and wanted to go back to the bar, where I came from. When I heard about this vessel on Zaton, I decided to try my luck here. And then, fortunately, Cardan was in the spotlight, and after the story with his friends he went into a stop. He was looking for a helper and as it turned out the future successor. I was fond of weapons and ballistics before my appearance in the Zone, and here such a luck and a warm place.</text>

		<text>You're Cardan, right?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kardan_st_1">

	</string>
	<string id="kardan_st_7">
		<text>Joker and Barge. Both young and hot, all trying to prove something. Only they are both dead, their PDA brought me one stalker. I was drunk, and I wanted to get ready to look for them. Stalker was ahead of me.</text>

	<string id="azot_st_1">
		<text>They call me Asot. I came from the base of "Debt" in the Bar, when it settled down here. I was repairing trunks and armor, and I had to deal with more subtle things.</text>

	<string id="azot_st_2">
		<text>Your friends are gone, but you were left surrounded by something like "enemies", how so?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="azot_st_3">
		<text>There is no Bar and no Arms, no enemies here. Local society appreciates me and I appreciate it, although I do not like Freedom.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="azot_st_4">
		<text>And what are the more subtle types of work?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="azot_st_5">
		<text>Yes, I had one “client”, then the “black box” drags, then the work with the elevator power supply will throw the old one. These are things of the past days, it became boring without “Debt”.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="azot_st_6">
		<text>Why?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="azot_st_7">
		<text>They have ongoing sweeps and operations. Either some creature will tear the armor, or the trunk will jam. In general, a job for me and fat. And these are just a jamb to indulge and neigh, from breakdowns only lighters.</text>

	<string id="loki_st_1">
		<text>So it is - Loki is my name, deputy Mikluha at this Station.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_2">
		<text>An interesting name - like the deity of the Scandinavian so called.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_3">
		<text>The way it is. It clung to me during a breakthrough through the "Burnout". Dashing times were.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_4">
		<text>Will you tell me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_5">
		<text>Good. When the Burnout was turned off, my detachment set out on a campaign to the North. They walked for a long time, wild places around. As the Chernobyl loomed on the horizon, they began to search for a place for the camp. Found this station abandoned and settled here. Next, start the fever of the Zone and "Duty" appeared. Unfamiliar places, few people, and emissions were more frequent. Having concluded a ceasefire, they agreed at the Station to hold their weapons in holsters and scabbard knives.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_6">
		<text>Where are these duties now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_7">
		<text>There are none of them whom they did not have time to shoot, they themselves fled. Not so long ago, one stalker loomed with us, their name was Sasha. Not sickly helped us, a lot of good deeds done. But the last straw was the information from the CPC of their founder, judging by which "Duty" was founded by the former military on a compulsory basis. Their captain (now the late "general") simply cut off contact with the headquarters. This infuriated the local stalker, just as puzzled some of the enemy fighters. After all, it was like at the station: purely equilibrium. And after the help of that stalker and fighters, we appeared, as if straight from the air, and there were plenty of defectors with sympathizers. Here we are the force of "Debt" and expelled from here.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="loki_st_8">
		<text>Where did this Stalker go?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_9">
		<text>I don’t know, but the last time he and the “company” were seen leaving towards Jupiter. And I was not up to it, to be honest.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_10">
		<text>Tell me about the surroundings. What is it worth to be afraid of?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_11">
		<text>The beasts are full. And to be honest, then we missed the "Monolithians", the bastards managed to settle in the old Depot. In general, they have a decent base there. In the north, Kopachi is full of zombies, in the area of the ventilation complex and the Volkhov air defense system, there are also a lot of them, keep an eye </text>
