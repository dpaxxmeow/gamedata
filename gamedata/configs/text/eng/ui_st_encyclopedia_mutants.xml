			\n Mutations and evolutionary adaptation have led to the strengthening of previously weakly expressed canine abilities, often at the expense of the habitual, and the emergence of new ones. As a result, animals are well aware of and bypass the anomalies, radiation and other invisible hazards that the Zone is teeming with. Well jumping.\n
			Vision and in many cases hearing completely lost, but there was an immunity to radiation and developed until a completely studied new "feeling", a kind of telepathic vision that allows dogs to feel the prey or danger literally through the walls. Scientists can not even really determine what internal body is responsible for this, although they have plenty of materials to study. Many dogs, especially those living in the depth of the Zone, use psi-abilities also for hunting, they bring down psi-attacks on the victim. \n
			There is reliable information that in the ancestors of blind dogs there were genetically altered thoroughbred dogs, grown in the laboratories of the Zone. However, any creature of the Zone rumors about the results of "experiments¿. \n
			\n\n
			%c[0,215,215,215]Origin.%c[default]\n
			\n\n
			\n Laboratory research in the field of breeding included experiments with the genetic material of thoroughbred dogs. It was assumed that a new kind of dog could be more effectively used to guard the perimeter of the Zone. It is known that artificially bred breeds are not as adapted to confront external factors as their wild relatives. The task of the experimenters was to show the degree of influence of "wild" genes on fitness for external natural and anthropogenic factors. It was decided to replace some areas of chromosomes of modern breeds of dogs with highly homologous areas of wild species. As a result of such manipulations, the transgenic dogs of the zone acquired several altered properties from wild dogs. In other words, they were artificially brought closer to the wild state. After the disaster, some laboratory samples left the laboratory and began to mate with mutant feral relatives in the Zone. Accordingly, their descendants have acquired new properties. As a result, there was a "genetic cocktail". The influence of the zone has been increasingly observed, and with each succeeding generation more and more. Due to the huge variety of the original genetic material of the dog of the Zone are superfit, since they have in their genome a lot of "sleeping genes" and just neutral mutations that can appear as positive when the conditions change. Not surprisingly, only qualified individuals have gone through natural selection, so in the Zone, to date, it is possible to find very predatory representatives of canine. As a result, for more than ten years, ordinary dogs soon degenerated here completely, giving way to a new species - blind dogs.\n

For some unknown reason they are afraid of Snork, immediately run away from them, not trying to defend themselves or attack.

			\n\n
			\n One or two dogs are not dangerous. Loners generally try to bypass armed men. Because dogs are blind, their flock can sometimes be quietly circumvented. When attacking them, they escape, attack themselves only if they are locked in a corner. But meeting with the pack should already be avoided. Well-fed dogs may not pay attention to the stalker. However, like all the creatures of the Zone, dogs have an accelerated metabolism and are full for a very short time. A poorly armed stalker should go around the flocks in a wide arc, move around the hills, high ruins - in time to notice the congestion of dogs. In the melee, however, the dog does not pose a particular problem. Two or three bullets or charge of a large fraction (or even better - a short burst) - deadly for a blind dog. The main thing is to dodge him and his fellow-workers.\n

Rapid mutation lead to a vast improvement in previously peripheral abilities, frequently at the expense of primary ones. The most notable biological change was the loss of sight, paired with an uncanny development of smell. As it turned out, blind cubs survived in the Zone as well as normal ones, if not better. As a result, the common dog quickly became extinct in the Zone, giving way to a new breed - that of blind dogs. The animals instinctively identify and avoid anomalies, radiation and other invisible dangers that plague the Zone. Like their wild ancestors - the wolves - blind dogs hunt in packs.

			\n\n
			\It hunts constantly in different places, but it prefers not to change its lair and desperately defends its dwelling in case of an attack by anyone, be it a human or a mutant. Because the bloodsucker's thermoregulatory system is close to that of the cold-blooded, its metabolism is slowed and depends on the temperature of the surrounding air, such as that of frogs. Because of this, the monster is invisible in the infrared spectrum. The bloodsucker, satiated with its victim's blood, digests it for a long time, sitting in its lair. The best living conditions for the bloodsucker are high humidity, darkness and temperature about 17-18 degrees Celsius, due to which it can be found in different kinds of dungeons and cellars, in the swamp or in abandoned buildings in the lowlands.\n  
			\n\n 
			A bloodsucker is a nocturnal creature. The retina of his eye has a large number of "sticks," which allows him to see in the dark and dusk better than during the day. In darkness, its pupils are dilated, so you can see its retinas in the light of a flashlight - a "red-eye" effect. But some individuals are able to hunt during the day, although it is possible that they are pushed to do this only by intense hunger. It will be more convenient to fight off a bloodsucker by standing against a wall or in a corner and attacking with a knife (if desired). The easiest way to fight a mutant is from an elevated position, because the bloodsucker can't get to you that way. \n 
			\n\n 
			Most striking is the ability of the bloodsucker to become invisible; this action is performed automatically and regulated by the eye retina. The mechanism of such a phenomenon is defined as the telephotography of the image appearing on the retina to the surface of the body, a diffuse transfer from the retina to the skin. The light stimulus is transmitted to pigment cells with diverging fibers - chromatophores, which are able to contract and expand, creating numerous color combinations. This makes the bloodsucker similar to a chameleon or cuttlefish, but it spends a lot of energy on this, and the more the mutant loses it, the better it becomes visible. It is impossible to wear a bloodsucker out with running and various athletic exercises, only the physical damage to his health will let him manifest himself literally. \n
			\n\n
			%c[0,215,215,215]Origin.%c[default]\n
			\n Bloodsucker is the result of the Chernobyl Scientific Research Institute of Parapsychology (CSRIP) experiments. The purpose of the experiments was to grow humanoid creatures, perhaps in order to obtain a new biological species - the DNA of the human embryos had an extrasensory effect. In the end, Bloodsucker was defined as a dead-end branch of evolution and "genetic rubbish"¿. \n
			After leaving the laboratories, the bloodsuckers continued to mutate throughout the years of the Zone's existence. \n

Radiation and anomalies left their mark on the physical appearance of the animal as well: its fur is entirely gone in some places, and long and bristly in others. The hooves have evolved into sturdy, sharp claws, the pupils have became colorless, and the boar's bald head is marred by pigmentation disorders and deep wrinkles.

Large herds of these mutants can pose a serious danger even for experienced and well-armed stalkers, so some stalkers issue a task to destroy Boars.\n

			\n Boar - herd Mutants, behave aggressively towards all enemies that have entered their territory. Unlike many mutants, they patrol their territory from time to time. The leader is the whole herd, the strongest and most aggressive individual. Among the leaders, the cannibalism is rare: they run into extreme rabies and attack their fellow tribesmen, and then devour them; when they die, the morale of the pack falls. Sometimes they fall into frenzy without reason. You are unlikely to meet them singly. \n
			Omnivorous. Do not hunt, eat dead victims or corpses. Like many Mutants-animals, they simply survive. \n\n\n

			\n Smaller in size animals (like rats or tushkanos) Boar may well eat, although they are not specially hunted. With flesh periodically grazing together, but just as often and conflict. Blind dogs are driven away if they come too close, in turn, dogs often attack young boars. Wild boars when faced with a Bloodsucker or a pseudo-dog, they attack at once, but they will be able to overcome only the number. Try to stay away from Pseudogiant and Chimera, but sometimes relying on numerical superiority attack them. Like flesh, they have almost no psi protection, so they easily obey the controller. Neutral to the Poltergeist and Zombies. \n

			\n\n
			\n Boars, especially those who are the leaders of the herd, are extremely aggressive; If the stalker goes to their territory, then we should wait for the attack. These are devoid of any trick: relying on their size, powerful fangs and hoofs, Boar attacks from a takeoff, flying directly at the enemy, trying to knock him down and then tear his fangs and hoofs. Rarely when found alone, most often a group of three individuals. As in the case of blind dogs, it does not move very fast, and in close combat has extremely low maneuverability, which makes it no more dangerous than a tuskan (in case you have at least a bleed). You can avoid contact altogether, as Boar is very easy to notice, and he himself is blind. However, when you are attacked by a large swarm the situation changes dramatically. It is recommended to put them closer, and immediately after the shot sharply jump off to the side: next the running Boar will fly by, exposing the vulnerable (especially for the fraction) side. Repeating this simple combination of actions, you can have in your arsenal even a double-barreled gun to easily deal with a large (from 4 mutants) pack. \n

			\n Burers are the result of genetic experiments conducted by special services on criminals to develop human telekinetic abilities. These are fat low freaks with hypertrophic features in the remains of clothes - a worn out form and black raincoats. They can move heavy objects by the mere force of thought, and also create invisible power barriers. Once bureurs were ordinary people, most likely prisoners or stupid volunteers who were not fortunate enough to get into the program to strengthen the supernatural, in particular telekinetic, human capabilities. As a result of the side effect, they turned into real monsters - they lost their human image and went mad. The burghers are alien to human morality and compassion, they kill people for entertainment and food, using a variety of tricks from their supernatural arsenal - there are cases when these freaks lured stalkers into an ambush, posing as normal people. Spacious clothing, most likely being the remnants of a special form, which bureurs cherish much more than other Zone Mutants, helps them get away with a person (at least from afar). Most of these creatures still live close to the abandoned laboratories that spawned them.. \n  
			\n\n
			Their main weapon is their supernatural abilities, allowing to lift objects into the air and throw them at enemies. Also, at a distance, they can lift large objects (to a passenger car) into the air and create a telekinetic explosion that eases in an animated and inanimate objects with equal ease. No less interesting is the ability of the burer to create a gravitational field that protects the mutant, for example, from stalker bullets or grenades. \n  
			\n\n
			Virtually can not keep under control the published sounds: if you do not hear the muttering of the bureurs - then they are simply not there. They can make a sound that resembles a human voice or a child's crying as a bait. The burers also walk very loudly, often giving out their location. Some stalkers heard that they were saying some words "in a very low voice, similar to the voice of Darth Vader." Create around yourself a gravitational field that protects them from bullets. \n
			\n\n
			%c[0,215,215,215]Origin.%c[default]\n
			\n\n
			\n Like the controller and Izlom, the burer is the result of the "Universal Soldier" program, conducted by the CSRIP. One of its branches is telekinesis. Subjects underwent implantation of extrasensory enhancers, which gave them the ability. They also know how to cause auditory hallucinations in children - child crying. Later, experiments began on the cultivation of humanoid creatures, in one of which the bureras were to be obtained, - on the embryos of people, extrasensory influence was experienced. \n

			\n Chimera has the appearance of a four-legged creature with two heads, one of which is underdeveloped. The chimera has a duplicate system of internal organs (including the brain, but one, like the head, is underdeveloped), which makes it easier to endure injuries - if it damages one heart, the other will continue to function. There is no central circulatory system. The whole body is permeated with capillaries, with wounds this gives the chimera huge chances to survive, despite the loss of blood. The mutant is capable of quick regeneration of both small scratches and damaged limbs. As a weapon uses huge claws on the front paws. According to unofficial data, the chimera was created as a universal Animal-defender in one of the Zona laboratories, possibly in the X18 laboratory (the project "Universal Animal Army Protection"). Chimeras are monstrously strong, deft and cunning. This kind of mutant is one of the most dangerous in the Zone. \n  
			\n\n
			%c[0,215,215,215]Origin.%c[default]\n
			\n It is the result of genetic experiments under the program "Universal Animal Protector" - embryos of unknown animals underwent extrasensory influence on DNA. At the same time, the chimera was defined as a dead-end branch of evolution, which continued to be "grown" and studied. Has a large muscular body with powerful paws and two heads. Paws have sharp enough claws - the main weapon of the mutant; The hind legs are especially powerful, which is confirmed by protracted jumps at the level of her head. Immune to certain anomalies and radiation, has a high intelligence in comparison with other mutants. In chimeras, a duplicated system of internal organs and an additional brain, that is, most likely, the 2nd head of a mutant is something like a reserve brain - this makes the process of killing it very problematic, as well as accelerated regeneration. \n  
			\n\n
			It is not known when chimeras hit the wild, but the first stalkers already reported these mutants. Their habits and movements are reminiscent of a panther. During the bout, he hides behind shelters and is not put under fire. Runs around the enemy in circles and jumps from place to place. The attack basically makes jumps, it hits near if it does not land on the target, but next. After the attack, if he can not immediately get the enemy near attack, then whenever possible jumps off for cover, if there is no shelter, then simply aside. \n

			\n The Chimera always appears unexpectedly, loves to attack from the back. If detected, it may retreat, but not for long. Due to some properties of the legs, Animal can move almost silently, and it is often possible to determine that the chimera is nearby, only by motion sensors.

			\n The chimera hunts mostly at night, but, being very hungry, it can attack in the daytime. Chimeras are extremely aggressive and, meeting representatives of someone else's species, often attack. Often, they always come out victorious. The only mutant that is too tough for a chimera is Pseudogiant, but the two chimeras, acting together, can kill him. Always fighting with Burers and Snorks. The least dangerous enemies for a chimera are Boars and flesh, because at one its form they escape without analyzing the road. Neutral to blind dogs Bloodsucker and pseudo dogs. tushkanos and Poltergeist are not of interest to her.

			%c[0,215,215,215]Attitude to people and advice to the stalker.%c[default]\n
			\n\n
			\n Seeing a person, she usually sneaks from behind and attacks. If the chimera has noticed a stalker, she will attack him until she kills, which does not give her chances to escape from her. In the event that you have time to dodge the attacking chimera, try to shoot it from behind. Guess your movement under her jumps, dodge and jump away - it's important not to lose sight of her. Keep the monster away for short distances and do not let him use claws. A good result is also provided by the following method - climb up the hill (for example, on the roof of the garage) and shoot it from above. At light and medium levels, the difficulty does not pose a great danger, but at the difficulty levels, "Veteran" and "Master" poses a mortal threat to the life of the player. \n
			\n\n
			There is one trick in the battle with the chimera: the pillar. If you stand behind a pillar or any similar object (a thin tree, a rack of power lines, a grid fence) through which the Chimera can not jump, she will helplessly hack into the obstacle and will not be able to reach you, constantly jumping off and again attacking the pillar, if you, of course , will keep up with him for hiding. Having adopted this tactic and having a good reaction, you can destroy a mutant without a single touch.\n
			\n\n
			The most effective tactic is an underbarrel grenade launcher. The most important thing is to shoot the chimera under your feet until she has time to jump.

			%c[0,215,215,215]Origin.%c[default]\n
			\n\n
			\n Strictly speaking, controllers appeared as a result of experiments conducted in the Zone by Common-consciousness scientists in the X16 laboratory. After the first Emission, the X16 laboratory was damaged, and the experimental ones were left to themselves. Outwardly, the controller looks like a man of thick build with a disproportionately large head, on his head pathetic hair, deep set, bulging eyes, pulsating ulcers on either side of the head, torso wrapped in rags or bandages, dressed in old rags or pants / jeans. Controller's peculiarity is the impact on the mind of his victim, subjecting it to his will - when he meets a stalker or another weaker mutant, at the expense of the abilities of a developed and mutated brain, tries to take the victim under control. The psycho-blow of the controller inflicts considerable mental damage, the control over his actions is lost, accompanied by an incredible headache and there is a feeling that the limbs are filled with lead, it takes more than one hour to depart from the meeting with him. The controller moves slowly, in SC when approaching the monster, a close stalker receives damage without visible actions on the part of the controller, whereas in CP and CS he can strike the stalker with his hands.. \n

			\n Controller, despite his strong mental abilities, is quite a coward. With sharp attacking actions of the enemy, 	controller disappears from sight trying to catch the enemy by surprise. It lives in dungeons, laboratories and ruins of old buildings, only very strong hunger can force them to lean out of their shelters, but sometimes it also occurs in open terrain. Controllers are in the habit of keeping an entourage with them, consisting mainly of zombies, dogs and snorkers, which serve as both guard and food for them. If he takes control of a stalker, he most often forces to shoot at his own groupmates. \n

He is able to disorient the victim and not let her concentrate. The presence of the controller is shown by a blue screen, which is similar to illusions, there is also a ringing in the ears and a slight swinging, which hints at psychotropic pressure. Since it is almost impossible to get into the head of the controller, being under his influence, it is worthwhile to shoot where it is easier to get to - the stomach. It is also possible to successfully attack a monster with a grenade launcher, but it's best to remove the controller from a distance, until he sees you, in tight spaces it's best to hide around the corner and throw grenade at the mutant. \n

			\n Flesh - mutated to the unrecognizability of the pig, one of the most harmless mutants in the Zone. \n  
			\n\n
			The forelimbs turned into insect-like legs - sharpened toothy "saws", which Flesh uses to dig out roots, tearing down carrion, attack and defense. The bones are thickened, therefore, because of the large weight of the skeleton, flesh often needs to rest. Flesh has a high degree of regeneration, which allows them to recover quickly after injuries. Despite the omnivore, the inner structure of the flesh is still approximated to the herbivorous, and not predatory, animal. The stomach is well stretched and digests food for a long time because of an irregular diet. The eyes of the flesh also evolve - one gradually decreases (but does not disappear at all), the second has the ability to quickly rotate in different directions, and the third eye Flesh can "smell," said the famous scientist Sakharov. \n

			\n Pigs also underwent mutations as well as all other organisms in the Zone. The new ecological situation is characterized by increased activity of new environmental factors, including numerous mutagenic factors. By acting in a complex, physical, chemical, biological, and anomalous mutagenic factors lead to new Type mutations that affect all levels of organization of the genetic material of organisms - DNA. In different parts of the zone, the activity of some factors varies, as a result we can observe a wide variety of manifestations of the mutational process. One of the brightest examples is "Flesh" - a mutated domestic pig. It can be said with certainty that the genetic information of this organism was subject to significant influence of mutagens. The genes controlling the basic life processes and ways of metabolism were touched, from which, the phenType of the animal was greatly changed. The very existence of this mutant is a great miracle, since most mutations lead to a fatal outcome. \n

			\n Flesh will protect their lair from several stalkers, but when a large group appears, they will most likely run away. If you attack the flesh - they will start to run around and bewilder. They will unexpectedly beat from different sides, spontaneously counterattack. The best advice is to kill a few, then the flesh will disappear in a panic. It is also desirable to press your back against the fence or boulder, so that the Mutants do not surround you. If there is a Boar in the pack - kill them first: Avoid their attacks and hit in the back. Against such flocks fit shotguns and submachine guns, against a couple of individuals can use a pistol.

			\n Until now, it is not clear who is a subspecies - a dwarf or a burer? Be that as it may, dwarfs are much more common. They were also formed as a result of experiments under the "universal soldier" program. Because of the dwelling in the dungeons, their skin is pale yellowish-white with a hint of green, blind from light. Well (but not like the bureurs), telekinesis and foresight are developed and fight hands well. Their head is also hypertrophied. Degree of reasonableness is very high. \n  
			\n\n
			The ugly dwarf, dwells in the dungeons, does not like to appear in the light. Dwarfs have very powerful hands, with which they can tear their victims, developed intellect and quick reaction. The character of dwarfs is extremely vile, nervous anger forces them to commit wild and unexpected acts. Their character, along with intelligence, makes them one of the most dangerous enemies in the Zone. They have a strong foreboding and telekinetic abilities.
			There is a collective mind. Immunities to radiation, succumb to psi-radiation. At a fright they run up with a squeal, like a child's.
			During the run, they quickly move their small feet. Approaching 5-10 meters to a place with shelters stops and tries to feel the enemy at a distance. In his absence, continues to move.\n

			\n A huge drop-shaped monster up to two meters tall. For movement and attack uses the so-called "hand-held", always attacks the forehead. Quite tenacious. It attacks either coming up close, or "slapping" the hypertrophied limb about the ground, creating a local shock wave. Presumably, it is an asexual being. Has a cumbersome formless body and an underdeveloped leg under the tail. Despite this he runs well, he is cheerful in counterattacks. The Pseudogiant has a large, slightly smaller body and a head that is disproportionately small in relation to the body.

			\n The mutant hunts solely alone. Pseudogiant do not have a special tactic of hunting, they attack without any thought into the forehead of any prey. Pseudogiant huntes at any time of the day, often found in underground laboratories, but can also be selected outside. At the sight of a man with a roar they rush at him. Mostly he eats only killed prey, but sometimes he does not disdain to carrion. \n

			%c[0,215,215,215]Relationships with other mutants.%c[default]\n
			\n\n
			\n Hostile to almost everyone. It is known that Pseudogiant does not hunt tushkanos (they are too small to be his prey and he kills them solely in self-defense), and hates chimera and bloodsuckers, since they are his strongest enemies from mutants, due to the fact that they possess very high mobility and Vitality. He also attacks the pseudo-dog and blind dogs, furiously fights with Boar and flesh. Burers, Snorkes and controllers try to avoid meeting him, but they are not talking about open hostility, because they are, in most cases, neutral to each other. The only mutant that is not of particular interest to Pseudogiant is the Poltergeist (most likely it is because he can not catch up and kill him). \n

			\n These are truly supernatural beings, found only in the depths of the Zone. They live, as a rule, inside dilapidated buildings. In their non-material form, they are half invisible, since they represent a certain clot of supposedly electricity. Reminiscent of a human body without legs.

			\n\n
			%c[0,215,215,215]Origin.%c[default]\n
			\n\n
			\n The origin of the Poltergeists stalkers is reliably unknown. But there is a legend that these are the spirits of stalkers caught under the ejection. In fact, Poltergeist - the victim of experiments on the transformation of matter into the field structure. \n

			%c[0,215,215,215]Lifestyle and behavior.%c[default]\n
			\n\n
			\n Constantly flies his territory, does not do anything else. The enemy feels at a great distance and attacks immediately. At the detection the victim hears a certain similarity of a low beeping of small loudness. At close range, the psi-abilities of the Poltergeist begin to appear, and the visual perception of the enemy's world changes color to blue-violet (regardless of subspecies).\n
			At death, it breaks up into bloody scrapes that literally evaporate in the air. You can also hear a deaf echo, similar to howling and groaning at the same time. When a telepathic Poltergeist is applied to damage, it emits an electrical sound. \n
			\n\n
			%c[0,215,215,215]Relationships with other mutants.%c[default]\n
			\n\n
			\n Since Poltergeists almost always live in dark and underground rooms, occasionally leaving there, they very rarely meet other representatives of the fauna of the Zone. If they were in an open area, they would be at enmity with blind dogs, Boars, pseudo dogs and flesh. \n

			\n\n
			\n Powerful musculature and a modified skeleton allow this monster to move with incredible Speed and make huge swift jumps. The pseudo dog is very resistant to radiation and shock anomalies. There is evidence that a large strong individual without serious damage will survive and acquaintance with "Kisel". He jumps far and, perhaps, knows how to "teleport" for short distances. \n
			The psi-possibilities of pseudo-dogs, with the exception of some subspecies, are small. Mature individuals are capable of inflicting psi-strokes on the victim, if it is a question of stalkers, then to direct the directed weapon away from theirself. \n
			The first meeting with the pseudo-dog makes an immense impression on the beginner - sometimes fatal. Many stalkers consider the pseudo-dog to be the real "spirits of death" of the Zone. However, with experience, the causeless fear of this objectively not the most dangerous creature passes. \n  
			\n\n
			%c[0,215,215,215]Origin.%c[default]\n
			\n\n
			\n When looking at the appearance of a pseudo dog, it seems very doubtful that it has originated from a wolf. The form of the muzzle of the animal has been changed so much that discussions are still going on about whether the pseudo-dog is a mutation of the known species of animals or has taken place as a separate species. \n
			Strictly speaking, there is not much left of the wolf in the pseudo-dog. Most of all, the head was changed: round, with huge, but not very prominent jaws, armed with numerous huge teeth, growing throughout the life of the animal. At a sight the more or less similar breed of a dog - the bulldog is recollected. Also in the guise of it there is something anthropomorphic, but very distant, so one can not assert with absolute certainty the mutation of this monster of the Zone from the animals known to us. \n
			\n\n
			%c[0,215,215,215]Lifestyle and behavior.%c[default]\n
			\n\n
			\n These creatures lead a territorial way of life and violently attack anyone who invades their possessions. They are often found singly, but they can also be found in pairs and small flocks, in a half-dozen individuals (in the most extreme cases, you can see a flock of ten individuals). Often you can see how the pseudo-dog is led by a flock of blind dogs. But it is unlikely that this "cooperation" extends beyond one joint hunt. Pseudo dogs can be tamed, but you need to start with a very small puppy. There are at least two stalkers known to have succeeded: the Doctor has a dog Druzhok, and Noah has a female dog, Lessie, who later brought off her offspring who helped a group of stalkers who hid themselves in the barge from mutants when they attacked it during a particularly powerful emission.\n

			\n\n
			\n Alone, the pseudodog attacks any mutant that is smaller than its size (for example, tushkanos or rats). From larger mutants escapes at the first sight. But being a pack, they will attack anyone who invades their territory or disturbs during the feast. They have ubiquitous enemies - Boar and flesh. In the battles with them, as a rule, they win. Stronger opponents for them - Snorki, Burer and Bloodsucker, whom they are able to overcome only a large number. The most dangerous enemy for a pseudodog is Pseudogiant, who, because of powerful attacks and a huge amount of health, can kill a whole flock alone. Pseudo dogs are neutral to chimeras, controllers and Poltergeist am. Among the allies - only fellows and blind dogs, with whom pseudo dogs often arrange joint hunting.\n
			\n\n
			%c[0,215,215,215]Battle tactics.%c[default]\n
			\n\n
			\n A pseudo dog does not differ either intellect or population (rarely when you can see more than three monsters in one flock). It moves though fast, but without completely maneuvering, which makes it an easy target, even for the inexperienced shooter. In addition, she always attacks the enemy at an angle of 90 degrees, and if you take into account that her massive head occupies about half of the chest, then even an unnecessary line is likely to hit the mutant in the face, which in the presence of an appropriate caliber can kill it on place. In the event of a collision with the pack, only the number of targets changes, but the tactic remains the same - letting it get closer and putting lead in the throat. In general, this species is not far away from blind dogs and in some ways even inferior to it. \n

			\n\n
			\n Rats are the constant companion of man. And in the places where people left, they are even more free to live. Apparently, factors such as radiation and Habitat played a role here. It is unlikely that these rats, by habits and physiology, have gone far beyond the usual. Do not give in to radiation and easily adapt to other unfavorable factors. \n
			\n\n
			%c[0,215,215,215]Origin.%c[default]\n
			\n\n
			\n Many animals had to mutate in order to win the right to life from the Zone. But gray rats are already brilliant masters of survival. Rats are not from the underground laboratory complexes, they are the true owners of the Zone, and not its children. Perhaps they are carriers of anthrax.\n
			\n\n
			It is difficult to imagine a more adapted organism. Radiation and anomalies practically did not affect rat physiology, but forced them to learn to recognize new dangers. This known resistance of rats to the effects of radiation is explained by the effectiveness of their DNA repair systems. Rapid reproduction rates and a large number of descendants allow them to quickly adapt to new environmental conditions.\n
			\n\n
			Apparently, thanks to the still poorly studied psychoethological features, the rat pack acts as a whole organism. In fact, single individuals do not represent anything interesting from the point of view of science. Only in the pack of rats are their most interesting properties, such as collective intelligence. Moreover, the more individuals in the pack, the more coordinated its actions. This interaction is similar to that in fish groups. But on land scientists met with a similar phenomenon for the first time. To coordinate the actions of the rat, apparently, use a special kind of psycho-wave communication, it is not excluded and the option with ultra- / infrasound. The latter has several proofs in his favor: for example, rat insanity. A single individual issuing an infrasound of a certain frequency is not taken into account as dangerous. But the pack, using coherent waves and the amplification effect (interference), is already a real threat to the life of the stalker. Also, the effect of rat insanity can be caused by toxins or microorganisms contained in saliva and on the teeth of rats.\n
			\n\n
			The scent and hearing of rats became much better; rather than as it was before, it was due to a deterioration in vision. It is due to hearing that the rat pack can act reasonably, make constant contact with other members of the flock through ultrasound. Infrasound is used only as a means of attack. The heads of each pack are rat wolves - they are very large, in relation to other rats, individuals, probably representing a subspecies or other species. The genetic similarity of rat wolves to ordinary rats is quite high, allowing a certain degree of kinship between them. Due to the size and special body, they can "broadcast" ultrasonic signals for the whole flock. 
			\n\n

	<string id="encyclopedia_mutants_rat_text2">
		<text>
			As a resonator for ultrasound production, they apparently use a special organ, which is a fat body surrounded by a connective tissue in such a sound lens. It is located in the cavity of the skull. An interesting feature is that small rats have an asymmetrical arrangement of teeth on the lower jaw: the right dentition is slightly shifted forward relative to the left one. The resonator for capturing ultrasounds in rats is precisely the lower jaw: from the sound-collecting organ (the auricle, Medium ear), a signal is transmitted through the fiber system to the lower jaw to enhance and differentiate. Each branch of the jaw is innervated by its own nerve, which has branches to each tooth. Since one row of teeth is further away, impulses from it come later. As a result, there is interference of sound waves, their analysis allows the rat to determine their character, direction and frequency. \n
			\n\n
			Vision of the rats, as they thought before, was no worse - in fact, the ratio between the rods and cones in the direction of the sticks slightly shifted (the sticks are responsible for the night vision), that is, the rats became better seen in the dark, but worse by light. In the dark their eyes glow red. To catch electromagnetic fields in rats there is a special organ: vibrissae, that is, their mustache, they play the role of such antennas. \n
			\n\n
			All scientists who studied the biology of the Zone agree that the rats perfectly adapted to the new conditions. It is difficult to imagine a more adapted organism, because a large number of offspring and fast current natural selection allow rats to adapt in the most severe conditions. \n

			\n\n
			\n Rats meet in packs, in rare cases you can meet them alone. Rats feel dangerous places and carefully bypass them, warning the squeals of their brethren. They are very smart creatures and try to attack the victim from different angles. The victim, surrounded on all sides, has very little chance of surviving. They live in abandoned places and in dungeons. Perhaps they communicate by ultrasound, but this has not yet been proven. \n

As described above, they attack stalkers, jumping on their backs and trying to bite the neck between 3 and 4 vertebrae. \n

As a result of irradiation and life on nature, the hairline disappeared, the body is strewn with bruises and wounds. The gas mask is shifted so the so the mouth with absent lips and dark reddish gums are clearly seen. There is an opinion that Snorks wear gas-masks with a purpose, but what is the purpose still unclear. They move using four limbs, often bend and crawl, constantly sniff the ground searching the ravin. Because of the destruction of cartilaginous material, the creature goes slightly hunched, as the spine can not endure permanent loads on the interlayers. The internal structure of the limbs has changed: a large number of tendons have appeared, allowing Snorks to make incredible jumps, to attack they approach to target like cats, trying to come from the back. They make sounds resembling an animal roar, sometimes they make sounds that resemble hooting, there are times when Snorks say something similar to curse. They live in packs, and organize a lair. \n

			%c[0,215,215,215]Origin.%c[default]\n
			\n\n
			\n Versions of their origin are similar: many believe that Snork is the next step in degradation of zombies. The similarity with zombies ranges from 17% to 26%. Snorks are a partly mutated zombies, this explains why there are a lot of them near to the psi-fields. Apparently, when the zombie finally lose its weapon and remnants of memory, a new model of behavior was developed, close to the animal. The upright movement pattern is replaced by crawling, which reduces visibility and increases the movement speed. There are three possible versions. \n

They have a lair usually underground (caves, underground laboratories). The largest lair was seen on Yantar on the  swamp behind the laboratory. Usually they crawl on the grawnd, sniffing in search of a ravine, and if it is found, they come up rushing and then they do a big jump with a kick. \n

			\n For Snorks many creatures are a potential prey. Livin in open terrain, they have ubiquitous enemies which are Boar and Flesh. Wkirmishing with them usually winand then fiercely pursue the ones who left the battle. Snorks always attack Blind doga and disperse their packs. To pseudodogs the attitude is same, but for Snork to beat them is difficult because of their high mobility. \n

			\n They will attack immediately any human. Shotguns are very effective against them. Do not think about long range combat Snork can jump very far and hits really hurt. The best option is a semi-close distance, so the mostre could not get enough space for and effective attack, and it is easy to predict his movements, and the aiming is easier. Keep in mind that Snork crawls when he moves, that allows the most part of pellets (if you will shoot at 90 degree angle) to hit directly in the head. \n

			\n The existence of snorks is shrouded in mystery like everything in the Zone, it is not clear where the new snorks come from. Also, perhaps this is one of the unsuccessful experiments of scientists on the project "Universal Soldier". Scientists may have wanted an obedient laboratory guard, immune to damage, capable of performing incredible leaps and firing on the fly, thereby dodging enemy attacks. Scientists have received: everything is the same, but naughty, aggressive, with animal instincts of a monster. In the X16 laboratory, there are corpses of dead single stalkers who died in a very strange way and began to mutate. If you look closely, their skin is suspiciously similar to the skin of a snork and some corpses were too similar to them. Especially in the laboratory about 7 snorks. Since all laboratories in the Zone belonged to O-Consciousness, it can be assumed that they were involved in the creation of snorks and this can be considered as a version, since O-consciousness has done too much useful for the Zone. \n

			\n Stalkers call these animals tushkanos. In fact, these animals are not related to all known tushkanos, although they are very similar to them. It is not yet possible to specify exactly the species from which the tushkanos of the Zone occurred, since they underwent very profound changes during the mutation process; one can only assert that their ancestors were schooled animals, most likely some kind of rodent. Reaching up to 40 centimeters at the withers, they are much larger, faster, more mobile, more aggressive and more gluttonous than the usual desert animal and in general have nothing to do with it genetically. They live mainly in dungeons and ruined buildings, feeding on everything that gets caught - from plants to inattentive stalkers. Sometimes even large animals become victims of carcasses and Mutants: attacking a large flock, they will easily tear apart any creature that has not managed to escape.. \n
			\n\n
			%c[0,215,215,215]Origin.%c[default]\n
			\n\n
			\n The fact that the tushkan is bred in the laboratory is confirmed by the fact that in X-18 in some chambers there are corpses of these rodents. Among stalkers, there are two opinions about the ancestor of these mutants: the first is a rat, the second is a mouse. \n
			In favor of the rat says the fact that the carcasses are aggressive and omnivorous. The second theory is supported by the fact that the tushkan has "mouse" ears, the number of fingers closer to the mice, and also the fact that the tail in the tusk is not as long as the rat's. \n

			\n\n
			\n Reaching 40 cm at the withers, they are much more mobile, more aggressive and more gluttonous than the desolate beast. They live mainly in dungeons and ruined buildings, feeding on everything that gets caught - from plants to inattentive stalkers. They usually live in flocks, sometimes even in very impressive flocks of up to 50 individuals. As a rule, for 5-10 individuals. Easily amenable to the controller - the brain has small dimensions. However, their strength lies in flocks - being in the pack, their amount of intelligence and strength increases dramatically. Thus, it can be said that tushkanos-individuals do not exist. Hunt a flock, attack the victim with a crushing herd, chasing her, leaving no chance of escape. Those who do not flee, get strong bleeding wounds, or even lose their lives. A wounded pseudo-dog has no chance of salvation, if a flock of these rodents has spotted it. They also want to refresh themselves with a ready-made breakfast or a sleeping stalker. The harbingers of tunnels and dungeons have tenacious sharp teeth, capable of digging their way into the industrial environment in which they usually live. They perfectly oriented in various tunnels, dungeons, bunkers in full or partial darkness. They live in the same place, respectively. A gaggle of carcasses can swallow the body in a couple of minutes, if until that moment they were starving for at least one day.\n

Mostly males, although there is no apparent difference between male and female. They feed on stalkers and half-decayed corpses-zombies, who can walk. An important difference is that the amount of gray matter is very large, but vision is poor. Dimensions are less than average.

The main thing is to not be too late. Here, you know, the most unpleasant thing is? It's very difficult to get on the tushkanos.

			%c[0,215,215,215]Origin.%c[default]\n
			\n\n
			\n There is no unequivocally proven version of the zombie-civilian origin, but there are several basic: \n 
			Degradation of zombified \n  
			Perhaps a zombie is a long-time zombie stalker who, after a long walk in the Zone, lost all his equipment and finally lost his identity. \n 
			Self-settelers \n 
			After the first explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, some people refused to evacuate and remained on the contaminated land. This version says that zombies are people who lived in the exclusion zone, which fell under the second release. Among them are not only settlers, but also prisoners, on which experiments and laboratory personnel were put. Two facts speak in favor of this version. The first - in the RA emissions actually turn stalkers into zombies. While the first release was much stronger than all subsequent ones, the person who fell under it degraded even more. The second fact is that on some zombies you can see the scientific form, for example: on an ordinary civil zombie. \n

			%c[0,215,215,215]Lifestyle and behavior.%c[default]\n
			\n Plant life, are neutral until they seek food, but are always hungry. When people try to find food, they attack people and animals. The bodies of some of them are so decomposed that they can not be distinguished from an old corpse, and because of the zombie habit of lying motionless for hours, careless stalkers can accidentally step directly on still living and dangerous zombies. Zombies of the military and stalkers are dangerous while "fresh" and have retained weapons. Then they degrade and finally go down - they lose all things, tear their clothes ... Usual condition - aimless walking around the Zone, they sit, doze, moan, mutter fragments of phrases. They can ask for something or say (ask them to save them, withdraw them from the Zone), if they find a prey, the zombie starts to move slowly in its direction, ignoring any dangers on the way. The inhibition of all physical processes in their body leads to the fact that it is difficult to kill them (they fall like dead, after a while they get up and try to attack, they go after the abuser).

But still, if you shot at him and he fell, do not rush to approach him: he will rise and continue to attack. For a medium-equipped stalker in large quantities are dangerous because of the great vitality. The most suitable weapon for shooting a zombie is a shotgun loaded with grape shot. No matter whether it's a double-barreled gun or a pump-action shotgun, it's important to try to plant as many pellets in the zombie's head as possible.

			\n%c[guide_blue] Rat wolf %c[default] he was a rare subspecies from mutated kind of rats.\n
			\nMuch more dangerous than the usual rats currently living in the Zone, the rat wolf was a merciless machine for killing.\n
			\nThese creatures often headed packs of ordinary rats and stood out sharply in their sizes.\n
			\n In addition to being about two to three times larger than an ordinary rat, there were only a few minor differences in their appearance - like large and completely black eyeballs.\n
			\n Natural selection ultimately played a role - because of their size, they were very prominent in the common pack and were easy prey for the cats of the Zone and other mutants.\n

			\n%c[guide_blue]Tark%c[default]  - died-out mutated horse.\n
			\n This being only slightly reminds the ancestors because of radiation of the Zone.\n
			\n Tark has no tail, hind legs are atrophied, lobbies are strengthened\n
			\n This "pseudo-horse" has big dimensions: about 3 meters in withers. The neck after mutations became most of all similar to the big muscle connected to powerful muscles of a back. Flesh of a mutant isn't capable to regeneration. The animal is extremely aggressive and unpredictable. Often meets in herds to five individuals. It is rather a remnant of antecedents, than herd instinct.\n
			\n Tark eat all. Their madness blocks sensation of fear. They Are hostile to all beings of the Zone. Unlike other mutants in the Zone they were incredibly wild animals, their madness often suppressed their perception of fear and probably promoted possible falling of their generation.\n
