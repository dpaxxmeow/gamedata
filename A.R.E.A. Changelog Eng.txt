A.R.E.A. - Atmospheric Realistic Expanding Addon, a global addon based on Call of Chernobyl. In the project was implemented 
a huge number of your own ideas, which greatly change the gameplay and reflect the author's vision of the Zone. The main idea of the 
project is an attempt to bring elements of realism to the game, without sacrificing the gaming component. In this zone, the player has 
to survive and fight, carefully thinking through every step and action. Those who like easy profits and fast travel, better to bypass 
the game. Despite a huge number of options, A.R.E.A. is not a customization simulator. For a complete immersion and experience, it is 
advisable to play with author's settings, without any edits or alterations.

-Added battery power scale for exoskeletons on HUD. Power consumption depends on the physical action of the player and the weight to be carried. If a suit is not equipped with a battery, it is difficult to move around in it and a fine is imposed on the carried weight.

Some traders exchange currency for electronic money, some cheaper, some more expensive. Money has the property of getting wet in the rain, and the traders do not take wet currency, so it is possible to dry it near a fire.
-Added a wallet, it's convenient to keep money or other small things in it. It also has a volume, so it is not bottomless, but money in it is protected from moisture.
